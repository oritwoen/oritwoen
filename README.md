# ✨ oritwoen

Hey there! 👋  
I’ve had this GitHub account for years, but only recently started actively building and sharing tools I always wished existed – especially in the realms of security, blockchain, and automation.

## 🛠️ What I’m working on

- **[ubichain](https://github.com/oritwoen/ubichain)** – TypeScript toolkit for working with wallets and addresses across multiple blockchains (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.), designed for edge/serverless environments  
- **[omnichron](https://github.com/oritwoen/omnichron)** – Unified interface for querying multiple web archive sources like Wayback Machine, archive.ph, and Common Crawl — great for OSINT, bug bounty, and recon

🔭 Just getting started – more tools, libraries and ideas coming soon!

## 💡 Why I build

I love creating lightweight, dependency-minimal libraries that:
- run anywhere (even at the edge ☁️)
- are easy to integrate into modern workflows
- give developers more power with less effort

Most of my work revolves around:
- 🔐 **Offensive tooling** for security & recon
- 🧠 **Automation pipelines** powered by AI/LLMs
- 🪙 **Blockchain dev** that avoids bloated SDKs
- ☁️ **Cloudflare Workers & serverless** architectures

## 🤝 Let’s connect

I’m always happy to chat about dev tools, OSINT, AI automation, or crypto tooling.  
Stars, feedback and contributions are super welcome! 🌟
